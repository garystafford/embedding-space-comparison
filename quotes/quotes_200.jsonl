{"inputs": "I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."}
{"inputs": "You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth."}
{"inputs": "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."}
{"inputs": "A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you."}
{"inputs": "Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."}
{"inputs": "We accept the love we think we deserve."}
{"inputs": "It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."}
{"inputs": "As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."}
{"inputs": "The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."}
{"inputs": "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."}
{"inputs": "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."}
{"inputs": "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up."}
{"inputs": "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."}
{"inputs": "There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."}
{"inputs": "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."}
{"inputs": "You love me. Real or not real? I tell him, Real."}
{"inputs": "You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there."}
{"inputs": "I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.."}
{"inputs": "I'm in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."}
{"inputs": "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."}
{"inputs": "Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."}
{"inputs": "People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."}
{"inputs": "If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."}
{"inputs": "You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}
{"inputs": "We're all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."}
{"inputs": "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."}
{"inputs": "The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space."}
{"inputs": "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever."}
{"inputs": "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."}
{"inputs": "When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."}
{"inputs": "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. After all this time? Always, said Snape."}
{"inputs": "I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing."}
{"inputs": "To die will be an awfully big adventure."}
{"inputs": "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."}
{"inputs": "So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."}
{"inputs": "Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can."}
{"inputs": "Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "He's not perfect. You aren't either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn't going to quote poetry, he's not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don't hurt him, don't change him, and don't expect for more than he can give. Don't analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he's not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don't exist, but there's always one guy that is perfect for you."}
{"inputs": "The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."}
{"inputs": "Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them, I said. Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway."}
{"inputs": "I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."}
{"inputs": "Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you."}
{"inputs": "When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always."}
{"inputs": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."}
{"inputs": "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving."}
{"inputs": "When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."}
{"inputs": "We love the things we love for what they are."}
{"inputs": "I would die for you. But I won't live for you."}
{"inputs": "In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."}
{"inputs": "You are, and always have been, my dream."}
{"inputs": "You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together."}
{"inputs": "I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)"}
{"inputs": "The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."}
{"inputs": "So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."}
{"inputs": "And now I'm looking at you, he said, and you're asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before – bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it – but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me."}
{"inputs": "Where there is love there is life."}
{"inputs": "Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary."}
{"inputs": "I would always rather be happy than dignified."}
{"inputs": "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."}
{"inputs": "Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}
{"inputs": "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."}
{"inputs": "The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever"}
{"inputs": "There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."}
{"inputs": "We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."}
{"inputs": "I think you still love me, but we can't escape the fact that I'm not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I'm not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I'm not angry, either. I should be, but I'm not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."}
{"inputs": "We loved with a love that was more than love."}
{"inputs": "And so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. What a stupid lamb, I sighed. What a sick, masochistic lion."}
{"inputs": "This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something."}
{"inputs": "Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet."}
{"inputs": "I heard what you said. I'm not the silly romantic you think. I don't want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don't want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."}
{"inputs": "A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"}
{"inputs": "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! "}
{"inputs": "Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something."}
{"inputs": "He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."}
{"inputs": "I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear."}
{"inputs": "What's meant to be will always find a way"}
{"inputs": "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love."}
{"inputs": "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing there is a field.I'll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about."}
{"inputs": "Everyone, at some point in their lives, wakes up in the middle of the night with the feeling that they are all alone in the world, and that nobody loves them now and that nobody will ever love them, and that they will never have a decent night's sleep again and will spend their lives wandering blearily around a loveless landscape, hoping desperately that their circumstances will improve, but suspecting, in their heart of hearts, that they will remain unloved forever. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to wake somebody else up, so that they can feel this way, too."}
{"inputs": "They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."}
{"inputs": "Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that's beautiful."}
{"inputs": "No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that's the key. It's like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot."}
{"inputs": "The heart was made to be broken."}
{"inputs": "Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."}
{"inputs": "I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."}
{"inputs": "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."}
{"inputs": "For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."}
{"inputs": "They didn't agree on much. In fact, they didn't agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."}
{"inputs": "You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me. She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. But I don't want anything else in the world."}
{"inputs": "I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."}
{"inputs": "Love is so short, forgetting is so long."}
{"inputs": "To douchebags! he said, gesturing to Brad. And to girls that break your heart, he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."}
{"inputs": "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."}
{"inputs": "The very essence of romance is uncertainty."}
{"inputs": "What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction."}
{"inputs": "There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."}
{"inputs": "My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away."}
{"inputs": "If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger."}
{"inputs": "Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it."}
{"inputs": "And, in the endThe love you take is equal to the love you make."}
{"inputs": "What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again."}
{"inputs": "It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head."}
{"inputs": "Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction."}
{"inputs": "I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life? ' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did? "}
{"inputs": "If he's not calling you, it's because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn't follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he's okay with disappointing you. Don't be with someone who doesn't do what they say they're going to do. If he's choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn't respect your feelings and needs. Busy is another word for asshole. Asshole is another word for the guy you're dating. You deserve a fcking phone call."}
{"inputs": "Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell."}
{"inputs": "I have something I need to tell you, he says. I run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him. I might be in love with you. He smiles a little. I'm waiting until I'm sure to tell you, though. That's sensible of you, I say, smiling too. We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something. I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear. Maybe I'm already sure, he says, and I just don't want to frighten you. I laugh a little. Then you should know better. Fine, he says. Then I love you."}
{"inputs": "You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have."}
{"inputs": "I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, 'So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me? ' I turn into him. 'Put you somewhere you can't get hurt."}
{"inputs": "If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets."}
{"inputs": "I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."}
{"inputs": "We're all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you've been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there's no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn't until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we're ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you're looking for. You're looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, This is the problem I want to have.I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way."}
{"inputs": "It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new."}
{"inputs": "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."}
{"inputs": "My dear, Find what you love and let it kill you.Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it's much better to be killed by a lover.~ Falsely yours"}
{"inputs": "If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don't let her go."}
{"inputs": "How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em."}
{"inputs": "If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him."}
{"inputs": "Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong."}
{"inputs": "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."}
{"inputs": "I love you. Remember. They cannot take it"}
{"inputs": "Do you think I'm pretty? I think you're beautifulBeautiful? You are so beautiful, it hurts sometimes."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea."}
{"inputs": "When love is not madness it is not love."}
{"inputs": "Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."}
{"inputs": "A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her."}
{"inputs": "Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited."}
{"inputs": "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."}
{"inputs": "True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning."}
{"inputs": "What's this? he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there. It's a girl, Jace said, recovering his composure. Surely you've seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one."}
{"inputs": "Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."}
{"inputs": "Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired."}
{"inputs": "I was smiling yesterday, I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything."}
{"inputs": "Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."}
{"inputs": "It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done."}
{"inputs": "I love you also means I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else."}
{"inputs": "There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. Is this the moment? Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. OI! There's a war going on here! Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. I know, mate, said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, so it's now or never, isn't it? Never mind that, what about the Horcrux? Harry shouted. D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem? Yeah --- right --- sorry --- said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."}

{"inputs": "Hate the sin, love the sinner."}
{"inputs": "Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness."}
{"inputs": "One love, one heart, one destiny."}
{"inputs": "I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be."}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it's these things I'd believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn't all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."}
{"inputs": "If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn't be filled? "}

{"inputs": "It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal."}
{"inputs": "We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved."}

{"inputs": "You couldn't relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. You had to accept it as a whole--like the world, or the person you loved."}

{"inputs": "It's probably not just by chance that I'm alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he's terribly strong. And if he's stronger than I, I'm the one who can't live with him. … I'm neither smart nor stupid, but I don't think I'm a run-of-the-mill person. I've been in business without being a businesswoman, I've loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men I've loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I've done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice."}
{"inputs": "Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being in love , which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident."}
{"inputs": "Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."}
{"inputs": "The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends."}
{"inputs": "Look after my heart - I've left it with you."}
{"inputs": "Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect."}
{"inputs": "One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well."}
{"inputs": "I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary."}
{"inputs": "And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me."}

{"inputs": "Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything."}

{"inputs": "I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a savage harvest, hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart, Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue."}
